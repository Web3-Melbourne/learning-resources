# Learning Resources
Resources for getting into Web3 development

## Introduction
This respository aims to put forward a curated pathway, from no coding experience at all, to seasoned veterans of multiple languages. The end goal of traversing these resources, is a position of readiness to develop decentralised applications on the Ethereum platform.

**Disclaimer**: This list is curated by volunteers, and the only thing they get from you progressing through this list is warm and fuzzies. There are many resources which we have omitted purely becuase we don't know about them. If you'd like to add anything, please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### I know nothing about Ethereum
Ethereum is a distributed, decentralised computer.

[This is a pretty good introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LK0t_qaPo)

If you really wanna go deep on theory, [here's a crowdsourced reading list](https://github.com/Scanate/EthList/blob/master/README.md) containing a bunch of links to talks/papers/articles which explain Ethereum concepts in more details.

### I have never written any code
Excellent. If you'd tried to learn to code a few years ago, it wouldn't be as easy. There are some great resources out there for getting started really quickly. [CodeAcademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) comes well recommended.

### I have dabbled in code but I consider myself a massive noob
Self awareness is a highly desirable trait. If you're still on the fringes of coding, you're probably again a good candidate for [CodeAcademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).

### I have written a few useful scripts
Baller. If you've done them in a language other than JavaScript, you might want to have a quick run through [CodeAcademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), but if you reckon you're going to conquer that too easily, head on down to [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io).

### I have never used JavaScript
[CodeAcademy's Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). If you reckon that's too easy and you're just looking to jump right into Solidity: [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io).

### I would consider myself proficient with JavaScript
[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)

[Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3js-api-reference)

### I have never seen Solidity code
[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io)

[Space Doggos](https://www.bitdegree.org/courses/learn-solidity-space-doggos/welcome)

This [Hacknoon 5-part series on Smart Contract development](https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-development-walkthrough-part-1-smart-contracts-b3979e6e573e) is very _very_ comprehensive, and you'll probably find yourself dipping in and out of it, but a few people have mentioned that it does a very good job of explaining the concepts necessary to build successful dapps.

### I have written some Solidity but never for production
First you'll want to set up your environment for development. We'll need `node` and `npm`.

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - This comes with NPM by default

[Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) - And highly recommend [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/)

[Getting started with Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/project)

### I have written production level Solidity before

Sweet. You probably don't need any of the tutorials in this file, but if you've never used Truffle I would highly recommend it.

Some things to think about (you may have done all of these too):

- [Automated tests](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/testing) (far more fun and rewarding than it sounds)
- [Writing a frontend for your dapps](http://truffleframework.com/docs/drizzle/getting-started) (React seems to be the framework of choice for most dapps)
- Writing some open source React Components
